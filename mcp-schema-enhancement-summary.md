# MCP Schema Enhancement Implementation Summary

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Added Comprehensive Asset Registry
- Created `ASSET_REGISTRY` constant with network and asset information
- Includes network names, symbols, native assets, and supported assets
- Currently supports: Torus (TOR), Bittensor (TAO), and Polkadot (DOT)

### 2. Created Unified Schema Method
- New `schema` MCP tool that consolidates all information
- Returns comprehensive schema for all data models in one call
- Network is now determined from environment variable (no need to pass as parameter)
- Includes database-specific documentation and cheatsheets

### 3. Enhanced Database Documentation

#### Memgraph (Graph Database)
- Added extensive Memgraph-specific Cypher examples
- **IMPORTANT LIMITS ENFORCED**:
  - Maximum path expansion: 3 hops
  - Maximum results: 1000 per query
  - Removed graph algorithm examples (PageRank, community detection)
- Added performance optimization examples
- Clear documentation of restricted operations

#### ClickHouse (OLAP Database)
- Added comprehensive ClickHouse SQL examples
- Covered MergeTree optimizations, PREWHERE, aggregations
- Time-series analysis patterns
- Array and JSON operations

### 4. Updated Existing Schema Methods
- Enhanced `money_flow_schema` with network/asset info and 3-hop limits
- Enhanced `balance_schemas` with ClickHouse-specific examples
- Enhanced `similarity_search_schema` with vector search examples
- All methods now validate network from `ASSET_REGISTRY`

### 5. Updated MoneyFlowTool
- Modified example queries to enforce 3-hop limit
- Added 1000 result limit to all queries
- Added `query_limits` section documenting restrictions

### 6. Deprecated Networks Tool
- The `networks` tool is now marked as deprecated
- All network information is available through the `schema` method

## Key Security and Performance Features

1. **Path Expansion Limits**: Maximum 3 hops to protect Memgraph
2. **Result Limits**: Maximum 1000 results per query
3. **No Graph Algorithms**: PageRank and community detection are computed during indexing
4. **Environment-Based Network**: Network determined from `NETWORK` env variable

## Usage Example

```python
# Get comprehensive schema (network from env)
result = await schema(ctx)

# Get schema without examples
result = await schema(ctx, include_examples=False)
```

## Environment Variables Required
- `NETWORK`: The blockchain network to use (e.g., "torus", "bittensor", "polkadot")

## Benefits
- Single entry point for all schema information
- Database-aware with specific optimizations
- Performance-protected with enforced limits
- Self-documenting with extensive examples
