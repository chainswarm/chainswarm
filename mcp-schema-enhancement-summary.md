# MCP Schema Enhancement Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the planned enhancements to the MCP server's money flow schema section, focusing on adding comprehensive query examples derived from `money_flow_service.py`.

## Key Changes

1. **Replace existing examples**: The current examples in `get_memgraph_cypher_cheatsheet()` will be replaced with new ones based on real-world query patterns from `money_flow_service.py`.

2. **Uncomment integration line**: Line 306 in `mcp_server.py` will be uncommented to include the cheatsheet in the schema.

3. **New category structure**: The examples will be organized into logical categories that reflect different analysis approaches:
   - Path Analysis
   - Community Analysis
   - Pattern Detection
   - Temporal Analysis
   - Performance Optimization

## Query Pattern Categories

| Category | Description | Example Queries |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Path Analysis** | Exploring connections between addresses | Shortest path, Path exploration with depth control, Directional path exploration |
| **Community Analysis** | Analyzing community structures | Aggregate community metrics, Inter-community transfers, Subcommunity extraction |
| **Pattern Detection** | Identifying specific transaction patterns | Fan-in patterns, Fan-out patterns, High-volume transfers |
| **Temporal Analysis** | Time-based analysis of transactions | Transaction frequency patterns, Regular transaction detection, Temporal sequences |
| **Performance Optimization** | Techniques for efficient queries | Index usage, Early filtering, Parameterized filtering |

## Implementation Approach

The implementation will require switching to Code mode to:
1. Replace the existing `get_memgraph_cypher_cheatsheet()` function
2. Uncomment line 306 in `mcp_server.py`

## Benefits

- **Practical examples**: Users get real-world query patterns they can adapt
- **Advanced capabilities**: Showcases the full power of the money flow graph database
- **Query construction guidance**: Helps users understand how to build complex queries
- **Best practices**: Demonstrates optimization techniques for better performance

## Next Steps

After implementation:
1. Test schema output
2. Consider adding more examples as new query patterns emerge
3. Document the available query patterns for users
