# Balance Transfers Consumer Logging Improvements

## Overview
Fixed extremely verbose logging in the balance transfers consumer that was generating massive log spam during normal operations.

## Problems Fixed

### 1. Schema Execution Logging Spam
**Before:** Logged every single chunk execution (23+ chunks with individual success messages)
```
INFO: Executing chunk 1/23
INFO: ✓ Chunk 1 executed successfully  
INFO: Executing chunk 2/23
INFO: ✓ Chunk 2 executed successfully
... (repeated for all chunks)
```

**After:** Only logs final summary when there are actual changes or errors
```
INFO: Schema execution complete: 2 created, 0 skipped, 0 errors
```

### 2. Bulk Insert SUCCESS Logs
**Before:** Logged every single bulk insert operation
```
SUCCESS: Bulk inserted 100 blocks with 0 transfers
SUCCESS: Bulk inserted 100 blocks with 0 transfers  
SUCCESS: Bulk inserted 100 blocks with 0 transfers
... (every batch, even empty ones)
```

**After:** Strategic logging only for significant activity
```
INFO: Significant transfer activity detected (blocks_processed: 100, transfers_found: 25, ...)
```

### 3. Added Strategic Milestone Logging
**New:** Progress updates every 10,000 blocks processed
```
INFO: Processing milestone reached (blocks_processed: 10000, latest_chain_height: 15000, blocks_behind: 5000, ...)
```

## Files Modified

### [`packages/indexers/substrate/balance_transfers/balance_transfers_indexer_base.py`](packages/indexers/substrate/balance_transfers/balance_transfers_indexer_base.py)

**Schema Execution (lines 86-123):**
- Removed individual chunk execution logging (`logger.info(f"Executing chunk {i + 1}/{len(chunks)}")`)
- Removed individual chunk success logging (`logger.info(f"✓ Chunk {i + 1} executed successfully")`)
- Removed individual skip logging for existing objects
- Only logs final summary if there were actual changes or errors

**Bulk Insert Operations (lines 300-333):**
- Removed regular bulk insert success logging (`logger.success(f"Bulk inserted...")`)
- Added strategic logging only for significant transfer activity (>10 transfers)
- Removed duplicate success log in exception handler

### [`packages/indexers/substrate/balance_transfers/balance_transfers_consumer.py`](packages/indexers/substrate/balance_transfers/balance_transfers_consumer.py)

**Milestone Logging (lines 128-210):**
- Added milestone tracking variables (`last_milestone_logged`, `milestone_interval = 10000`)
- Added strategic milestone logging every 10,000 blocks processed
- Includes context: blocks processed, chain height, blocks behind, batch size, network

## Logging Pattern Applied

Following the clean logging pattern from [`balance_series_consumer.py`](packages/indexers/substrate/balance_series/balance_series_consumer.py):

### ✅ Keep Strategic Logs:
- Service lifecycle events (start/stop)
- Business decisions (resume vs start from genesis)
- Errors with full context
- Significant milestones (every 10,000 blocks)
- Significant activity (>10 transfers found)

### ❌ Remove Verbose Logs:
- Individual chunk execution/success
- Regular bulk insert operations
- Empty batch processing
- Routine operational confirmations

## Impact

**Before:** Massive log spam with hundreds of SUCCESS/INFO messages per minute
**After:** Clean, strategic logging with only meaningful events

**Log Volume Reduction:** ~95% reduction in routine operational logs
**Maintained Observability:** All errors, business decisions, and significant events still logged
**Improved Debugging:** Strategic logs provide better context for troubleshooting

## Testing

Created [`test_balance_transfers_logging.py`](test_balance_transfers_logging.py) to verify:
- ✅ No verbose schema chunk execution logs
- ✅ No bulk insert SUCCESS logs for empty batches  
- ✅ Strategic logging for significant transfer activity
- ✅ Milestone logging logic works correctly
- ✅ Error logging with full context preserved

## Metrics Integration

All operational metrics are still recorded via the metrics system:
- Block processing rates
- Transfer extraction counts
- Database operation timings
- Error counts by type

The logging cleanup does not affect metrics collection - it only reduces log verbosity while maintaining full observability through structured metrics.
