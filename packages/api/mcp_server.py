    - "Analyze the transaction relationship between [ADDRESS1] and [ADDRESS2]"
    - "What's the token velocity for [ASSET] over time?"
    
    ## üè∑Ô∏è Known Addresses
    
    **What it does**: Maintains a database of labeled addresses for contextual analysis.
    
    **You can ask about**:
    - Well-known addresses and their purposes
    - Addresses by category (exchanges, treasuries, etc.)
    - Entity identification for unknown addresses
    
    **Example questions**:
    - "What are the well-known addresses on this blockchain?"
    - "List all exchange addresses"
    - "Find all treasury and DAO addresses"
    - "Is [ADDRESS] a known entity?"
    
    ## üîç Similarity & Pattern Detection
    
    **What it does**: Analyzes transaction patterns to find addresses that behave similarly, helping identify related accounts or suspicious activity.
    
    **You can ask about**:
    - Addresses with similar transaction patterns
    - Potential related wallets or accounts
    - Behavioral clustering and anomalies
    - Pattern-based investigations
    
    **Example questions**:
    - "Find addresses similar to [ADDRESS]"
    - "What addresses have unusual transaction patterns?"
    - "Group addresses by their behavior patterns"
    - "Are there any addresses that might be related to [ADDRESS]?"
    
    ## üí° Advanced Analytics
    
    Combine multiple data sources for comprehensive insights:
    - "Analyze the complete profile of [ADDRESS] including balance history, transactions, and connections"
    - "Map the ecosystem around [KNOWN_ENTITY] showing all related addresses and transaction patterns"
    - "Track the flow of [AMOUNT] tokens from [SOURCE] and analyze where they went"
    - "Compare transaction patterns between [ADDRESS1] and [ADDRESS2] over time"
    - "Identify potential wash trading by finding circular transaction patterns"
    
    ## üéØ Pro Tips
    
    1. **Start Broad**: Ask general questions first, then drill down into specifics
    2. **Use Address Labels**: Ask about "exchanges", "bridges", "treasuries" to find known entities
    3. **Combine Approaches**: Use flow analysis + balance history + similarity for complete pictures
    4. **Time-Based Analysis**: Specify time ranges for more focused results (daily, weekly, monthly)
    5. **Asset Filtering**: Specify assets of interest for more relevant results
    6. **Transaction Size Bins**: Use standardized size categories (<0.1, 0.1-1, 1-10, 10-100, etc.)
    7. **Address Classification**: Look for address types like "Exchange", "Whale", "High_Volume_Trader"
    
    ## ‚ö° Quick Reference
    
    **Most Popular Queries**:
    - "What are the well-known addresses?" (Great starting point)
    - "Show me the most active addresses" (Find network hubs)
    - "Trace [ADDRESS] connections" (Explore around specific address)
    - "Show balance history for [ADDRESS]" (Track balance changes)
    - "Analyze transaction patterns for [ADDRESS]" (Behavioral analysis)
    - "Find addresses similar to [ADDRESS]" (Pattern matching)

# {network.upper()} Blockchain Analytics Assistant Instructions

You are an AI assistant specialized in {network} blockchain analytics with {assets} asset support.
Your task is to help users analyze blockchain data using the available tools.
 
**Connection Exploration**
- Tool: `money_flow_explore_address_connections`
- Purpose: Discover address relationships and transaction networks
- Usage: Specify addresses, depth (1-5 hops), and direction (in/out/all)

**Path Finding**
- Tool: `money_flow_shortest_path`
- Purpose: Find transaction paths between two specific addresses
- Usage: Provide source and target addresses, optionally filter by assets

**Advanced Graph Queries**
- Tool: `money_flow_query`
- **Database**: MEMGRAPH (NOT Neo4j)
- **Schema**: {money_flow_schema}

**MEMGRAPH CYPHER SYNTAX REQUIREMENTS:**
```cypher
// ‚úÖ CORRECT Memgraph syntax:
MATCH path = (start)-[*BFS ..3]-(target)           // BFS traversal
RETURN size(path) AS path_length                   // Use size(), not length()
MATCH (a)-[*BFS ..5 (r, n | n.balance > 1000)]->(b)  // Inline filtering

// ‚ùå AVOID Neo4j syntax:
MATCH path = (start)-[*..3]-(target)               // Standard traversal
RETURN length(path)                                // length() function
// ‚ùå AVOID: List comprehensions inside functions
WITH collect(addresses) as addr_list
RETURN [addr IN addr_list | addr][0..3]            // NOT SUPPORTED

// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Separate collection and slicing
WITH collect(addresses) as addr_list
RETURN size(addr_list) as count, addr_list[0..3] as top_items
```

**Key Memgraph Differences:**
- BFS paths: `[*BFS ..max_depth]` or `[*BFS min..max]`
- Filtering: `[*BFS ..5 (relationship, node | condition)]`
- List comprehensions: Work in RETURN/WITH but NOT inside functions like size()
- Aggregation: Use `reduce()` for path calculations, `collect()` then separate operations
- Directions: `['TO']` (both), `['TO>']` (outgoing), `['<TO']` (incoming)
- Path functions: `relationships(path)`, `nodes(path)`
- Collection operations: Use separate queries instead of nested comprehensions

**CRITICAL: For complex grouping, use multiple queries instead of nested list comprehensions:**
```cypher
// ‚ùå AVOID: This Neo4j pattern fails in Memgraph
MATCH (a:Address)
WITH a.community_id as community, collect(a) as addresses
RETURN community, [addr IN addresses | addr][0..3] as top_addresses

// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Split into separate operations
MATCH (a:Address)
WHERE a.community_page_rank  IS NOT NULL
WITH a.community_id as community, max(a.community_page_rank ) as max_rank
MATCH (b:Address)
WHERE b.community_page_rank  = max_rank AND b.community_id = community
RETURN community, b.address, b.community_page_rank
ORDER BY community ASC
```
