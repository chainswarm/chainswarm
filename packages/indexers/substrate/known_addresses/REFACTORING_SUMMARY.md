# Known Addresses Module Refactoring Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the refactoring of the known_addresses module to align with the patterns established in the balance_tracking, pattern_detection, and block_stream modules.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Extraction

**Before**: The table schemas were hardcoded in the `ensure_tables_exist()` method of `known_addresses.py`.

**After**: 
- Created `schema.sql` file containing both table definitions
- Updated `ensure_tables_exist()` to load schemas from the SQL file
- Added proper documentation and comments to the schema

### 2. Documentation

**Added**:
- `README.md`: Comprehensive documentation covering:
  - Module overview and purpose
  - Architecture and components
  - Database schema details
  - Configuration options
  - Usage examples with code snippets
  - SQL query examples
  - Integration patterns
  - Best practices
  - Extension guidelines

### 3. Code Organization

**Improvements**:
- Modified schema loading to parse and execute multiple CREATE TABLE statements
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing functionality
- Improved error handling for schema loading

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: The module now follows the same organizational pattern as other indexers
2. **Maintainability**: Schema changes can be made in the SQL file without modifying Python code
3. **Documentation**: Clear documentation makes the module easier to understand and use
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Database schema is separated from business logic

```

## Migration Notes

No migration is required as the refactoring maintains full backward compatibility:
- The table structures remain unchanged
- All existing functionality is preserved
- The schema is loaded dynamically but creates the same tables

## Technical Details

### Schema Loading Implementation

The new implementation:
1. Reads the schema.sql file from the module directory
2. Splits the content by semicolons to separate multiple CREATE statements
3. Executes each CREATE TABLE statement individually
4. Maintains the same error handling as before

### Multiple Table Support

Unlike some other modules, known_addresses uses two tables:
- `known_addresses`: Main data table
- `known_addresses_updates`: Metadata tracking table

The refactored code handles both tables correctly by parsing and executing multiple CREATE statements.

## Future Improvements

1. Consider adding schema versioning for future migrations
2. Add unit tests for schema loading functionality
3. Implement automated address validation
4. Add support for bulk imports from multiple sources
5. Consider adding an API endpoint for address lookups
